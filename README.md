# Structural Geology
Hi,
\
\
This is a collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks for Structural Geology, and especially for my Bachelor course [Structural Geology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Oi4O0iZ7iYI4AsAV5JAsYzrB_M96L_y). The material is organized as:

1. Data in the data folder
2. Figures in the figures folder
3. Functions in the functions folder
4. Notebooks in the notebooks folder

Start in the notebooks folder and follow the notebooks. I suggest starting with the simplest notebook nb1.

I will keep adding notebooks. If you have any questions, please contact me at [nestor.cardozo@uis.no](mailto:nestor.cardozo@uis.no).
