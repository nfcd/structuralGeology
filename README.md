# structuralGeology
Hi,
This is a collection of Python Jupyter Notebooks for Structural Geology, and especially for my Bachelor course [Structural Geology](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1Oi4O0iZ7iYI4AsAV5JAsYzrB_M96L_y). I will be adding notebooks with time, starting with the simplest. If you have any questions, please contact me at [nestor.cardozo@uis.no](mailto:nestor.cardozo@uis.no).
