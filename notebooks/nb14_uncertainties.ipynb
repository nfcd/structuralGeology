    "# Notebook 14: Uncertainties\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainties are everywhere in geosciences. Everytime we take a measurement, there are uncertainties associated to this measurement, and everytime we look at data (e.g. seismic data), there are uncertainties associated to how these data were acquired, processed, displayed and interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainties (call them errors if you want) propagate through any calculation where we use measurements (or observations) with errors. If these measurements are statistically independent (they are uncorrelated with the magnitude and error of all other measurements), the general formula to propagate the error is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma_z=\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial a}\\right)^2\\left(\\sigma_a\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial b}\\right)^2\\left(\\sigma_b\\right)^2+\\left(\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial c}\\right)^2\\left(\\sigma_c\\right)^2+\\cdots}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is a multi-variable function $z=f(a,b,c,...)$ that depends on the measurements $a$, $b$, $c$, etc. $\\sigma_z$ is the uncertainty of $z$, and $\\sigma_a$, $\\sigma_b$, $\\sigma_c$, etc., are the uncertainty of the measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easy to calculate the formula above for simple cases (e.g. sum or multiplication of two variables), but it is difficult when the formulas are more complicated, or when we need to use several formulas to get the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately in Python, there is a library to deal with uncertainties and propagate errors as in the equation above. This library is called [uncertainties](https://pythonhosted.org/uncertainties/). So if you have not installed `uncertainties`, please do so by running the cell below:"
