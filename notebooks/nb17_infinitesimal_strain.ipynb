    "# Notebook 17: Infinitesimal strain from GPS data\n",
    "\n",
    "The global positioning system (GPS) has revolutionized Earth sciences by providing geoscientists with real time monitoring of active deformation. Continuous GPS measurements provide mm resolution of the displacement of stations. Because the changes in distance between stations is very small (10s of mm) relative to the distance between stations (10s of km), the strains measured by GPS networks are infinitesimal. The figure below shows this problem in two dimensions, for three points on an initial configuration $\\mathbf{X}$, which move to a final configuration $\\mathbf{x}$:\n",

Therefore, in 2D there are 6 unknowns, and since each station delivers 2 equations, we need a minimum of 3 non-colinear stations to determine the strain ellipse. In 3D there are 12 unknowns an each station delivers 3 equations. Therefore we need a minimum of 4 stations to determine the strain.\n",

For the Delaunay grid, the stations define the vertices of the triangles.
