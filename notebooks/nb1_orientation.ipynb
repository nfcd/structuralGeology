    "\n",
    "The orientation of a plane (e.g., bedding or a fault plane) is specified by two parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The strike, which is the angle that a horizontal line on the plane makes with the geographic north. This is an azimuth angle between 0 and 360Â°.\n",
    "- The dip, which is the angle that the plane makes with the horizontal measured on a vertical plane perpendicular to the strike. This is an angle between 0 and 90Â°.\n",

    "## Right-hand rule convention\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid any ambiguity with respect to the strike direction, the preferred choice is to give the strike such that the dip direction is 90Â° to the right of it. This is called the right-hand rule or RHR: If the palm of your right hand is on the plane and the thumb is along the strike direction, the other fingers will point towards the dip direction.\n",
