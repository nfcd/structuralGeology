    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Like strain, stress is a symmetric tensor. In 3D, the stress tensor $\\sigma_{ij}$ has nine components: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sigma_{i j}=\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\n",
    "\\sigma_{11} & \\sigma_{12} & \\sigma_{13} \\\\\n",
    "\\sigma_{21} & \\sigma_{22} & \\sigma_{23} \\\\\n",
    "\\sigma_{31} & \\sigma_{32} & \\sigma_{33}\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right]\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the tractions (force/area) acting on the faces of a small cube, whose sides are parallel to the axes of the coordinate system:\n",

    "<img src=\"../figures/stress_components.png\" alt=\"stress_components\" width=\"350\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto\"/><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, for the cube not to rotate about one of the axes, $\\sigma_{12} = \\sigma_{21}$, $\\sigma_{23} = \\sigma_{32}$, and $\\sigma_{13} = \\sigma_{31}$. Thus, the stress tensor is a symmetric tensor ($\\sigma_{ij} = \\sigma_{ji}$) that is defined by six components.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cauchy's law\n",
    "\n",
    "The stress tensor relates two vectors, the traction on a plane, $\\mathbf{t}$, and the pole to the plane, $\\mathbf{p}$. This is expressed by Cauchy's law ([Allmendinger et al., 2012](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/structural-geology-algorithms/C5AB97C135925A5D49726B741738DCA9)):\n",

    "\n",
    "### Transformation of the stress tensor\n",
    "\n",
    "If we know the components of the stress tensor in one coordinate system $\\mathbf{X_1X_2X_3}$, we can calculate the components of the tensor in another coordinate system $\\mathbf{X'_1X'_2X'_3}$ ([Allmendinger et al., 2012](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/structural-geology-algorithms/C5AB97C135925A5D49726B741738DCA9)):\n",

    "\\sigma_{i j}^{\\prime}=a_{i k} a_{j l} \\sigma_{k l}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{a}$ is the transformation matrix between the new and the old coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principal axes of stress\n",
    "\n",
    "Since stress is a symmetric tensor, there is one orientation of the coordinate system for which the non-diagonal components of the tensor are zero, and only normal tractions act on the planes perpendicular to the coordinate axes. These normal tractions are the principal stresses: $\\sigma_1$ is the maximum, $\\sigma_2$ is the intermediate, and $\\sigma_3$ is the minimum principal stress."

    "## Python functions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The function [cauchy](../functions/cauchy.py) calculates the tractions acting on a plane of any orientation, in a Cartesian coordinate system of any orientation. This function uses function [dircos_axes](../functions/dircos_axes.py) to calculate the direction cosines of the $\\mathbf{X_1X_2X_3}$ axes, from the trend and plunge of $\\mathbf{X_1}$ and the trend of $\\mathbf{X_3}$.\n",

    "2. The function [tranform_stress](../functions/transform_stress.py) transforms the stress tensor from a Cartesian coordinate system of a given orientation to another orientation.\n",

    "3. The function [principal_stress](../functions/principal_stress.py) calculates the principal stresses and their orientations for a given stress tensor in a Cartesian coordinate system of any orientation.\n",
