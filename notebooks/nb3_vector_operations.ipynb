    "# Notebook 3: Vector operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at four vector operations, and how these are very useful to solve different types of problems in structural geology:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scalar multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "To multiply a scalar times a vector, just multiply each component of the vector by the scalar:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$x\\mathbf v=[xv_1,xv_2,xv_3]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation is useful to reverse the direction of a vector, just multiply the vector by -1.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "To add two vectors, just sum their components. This operation is commutative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf u + \\mathbf v=\\mathbf v+\\mathbf u=[u_1+v_1,u_2+v_2,u_3+v_3]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dot product\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the dot product is a scalar and is equal to the magnitude of the first vector times the magnitude of the second vector times the cosine of the angle between the vectors. The dot product is commutative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf u \\cdot\\mathbf v=\\mathbf v \\cdot\\mathbf u=uv\\cos\\theta=u_1v_1+u_2v_2+u_3v_3=u_iv_i$$\n",
    "\n",
    "If the two vectors are unit vectors, you can see that the dot product is the cosine of the angle between the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\hat u} \\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat v}=\\cos\\theta=u_1v_1+u_2v_2+u_3v_3$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or in terms of the direction cosines of the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{\\hat u}\\cdot\\mathbf{\\hat v}=\\cos\\theta=cos\\alpha_1\\cos\\alpha_2+\\cos\\beta_1\\cos\\beta_2+\\cos\\gamma_1\\cos\\gamma_2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is a great way to find the angle between two unit vectors (two lines).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cross product\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the cross product is another vector. This vector is perpendicular to the other two vectors, and it has a magnitude equal to the product of the magnitudes of the vectors times the sine of the angle between the vectors:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf u\\times\\mathbf v=uv\\sin\\theta\\mathbf{\\hat l}=[u_2v_3-u_3v_2,u_3v_1-u_1v_3,u_1v_2-u_2v_1]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross product is not commutative. If the vectors are unit vectors, the length of the resulting vector is equal to the sine of the angle between the vectors. The new vector obeys a right-hand rule (see figure below); for $\\mathbf u\\times\\mathbf v$, the fingers curl from $\\mathbf u$ towards $\\mathbf v$ and the thumb points in the direction of the resulting vector, and vice versa:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/cross_product.png\" alt=\"cross_product\" width=\"500\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto\"/><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The cross product is great for finding the vector perpendicular to two non-parallel vectors. Since two non-parallel vectors (or lines) define a plane, this translates to finding the pole to a plane containing two non-parallel lines."
