    "# Notebook 4: The three point problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The three point problem is a fundamental problem in geology. It is based on the fact that three non-collinear points on a plane define the orientation of the plane. The graphical solution to this problem is introduced early in Geosciences. It involves finding the strike line (a line connecting two points of equal elevation) on the plane, and the dip from two strike lines (two structure contours) on the plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is an easier solution to this problem using linear algebra: The three points on the plane define two lines, and the cross product between these lines is parallel to the pole to the plane, from which the orientation of the plane can be estimated."
