    "Thickness is the perpendicular distance between the parallel planes bounding a tabular bed (e.g., sedimentary bed). This is also called the true thickness or stratigraphic thickness.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several trigonometrical relationships to compute thickness from the orientation of the planes bounding the bed, and the slope of the ground or inclination of the borehole the bed is intersecting ([Ragan, 2009](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/structural-geology/4D631885C9FBBCDEF90C555445ED1160#)). These formulas are useful but there is an easier way to compute thickness, mainly through a coordinate transformation."

    "## Coordinate transformations\n",

    "A coordinate transformation involves a change in the origin and orientation of the coordinate system ([Allmendinger et al., 2012](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/structural-geology-algorithms/C5AB97C135925A5D49726B741738DCA9)). We will refer to the new axes as the primed coordinate system, $\\mathbf{X'}$, and the old coordinate system as the unprimed system, $\\mathbf{X}$ (Figure a below).\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../figures/coord_transf.png\" alt=\"coord_transf\" width=\"750\" style=\"display: block; margin: 0 auto\"/><br><br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume there is no translation and the origin of the old and new coordinate systems is the same. The change in orientation of the new coordinate system is defined by the angles, $\\theta$, between the new coordinate axes and the old axes. In Figure a, these angles are marked systematically, the first subscript refers to the new coordinate axis and the second subscript to the old coordinate axis. For example, $\\theta_{23}$ is the angle between the $\\mathbf{X_2'}$ axis and the $\\mathbf{X_3}$ axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "To define the transformation, we use the cosines of these angles (Figure b). These are the direction cosines of the new axes with respect to the old axes. The subscript convention is the same. For example, $a_{23}$ is the direction cosines of the $\\mathbf{X_2'}$ axis with respect to the $\\mathbf{X_3}$ axis. There are nine direction cosines that form a 3 x 3 matrix, where each row refers to a new axis and each column to an old axis (Figure b). This matrix, $\\mathbf{a}$, of direction cosines is known as the transformation matrix and it defines the transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the transformation matrix, $\\mathbf{a}$, we can transform a vector from an old to a new coordinate system quite easily:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{aligned} & v_1^{\\prime}=a_{11} v_1+a_{12} v_2+a_{13} v_3 \\\\ & v_2^{\\prime}=a_{21} v_1+a_{22} v_2+a_{23} v_3 \\\\ & v_3{ }^{\\prime}=a_{31} v_1+a_{32} v_2+a_{33} v_3 \\end{aligned}$$\n",
