    "# Notebook 9: Rotations\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotations are essential in geology. For example, if from a current lineation on a tilted bed we want to estimate the direction of the current that deposited the bed, we need to rotate the bed (and the lineation) back to their pre- tilting orientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A rotation is also a coordinate transformation from an old coordinate system to a new coordinate system. The rotation axis is specified by its trend and plunge, and the magnitude of rotation is given by the angle $\\omega$ which is positive for clockwise rotation and vice versa. \n",
    "\n",
    "Without demonstration, the components of the transformation matrix, $\\mathbf{a}$, that describes this transformation are:\n",

    "1. A clockwise rotation of the strike line of the bed about the pole of the bed, an amount equal to the pitch of the lineation. This will give us the orientation of the lineation.\n",
    "2. A clockwise rotation of the lineation about the strike line of the plane, an amount equal to 180 - dip (since the plane is overturned). This will give us the pre-tilted orientation of the lineation."
